Crash text:

W...What happened?
Was that what I think it was?
That's certainly not what I came here for, but it might make an interesting story for later. Maybe I can snag some pictures if I can catch a glimpse of it again.
It could have at least not crashed my car...
How am I gonna get out of this one, Stacy...

Corpse 1:

Oh no. I recognize this person, though barely.
I think it's my coworker who came here to report on the same topic weeks ago.
He was never found...
At least now I can say rest in peace to poor Paul.

Corpse 2:

This guy was my company's main competitor.
He disappeared a while ago, but we didn't know why because they didn't want to hand the scoop to us.
Goodnight, John-boy.

Corpse 3:

This guy seems almost like he's chilling.
I guess it's kind of peaceful to be dead, huh?
Don't have to worry about... being chased by zombies?

Corpse 4:

Oh yeah, uh.........
This one is uh........
I think his name started with a T??

Corpse 4 small text:

My name was Daniel...

Poster:

"STAND BY THE BOYS IN THE TRENCHES
MINE MORE COAL
UNITED STATES
FUEL ADMNISTRATION"

Newspaper 2:

This newspaper is burnt. I can decipher a bit of it.
"Coal Mining and You: Healthy Power Source"
..."Currently, science is inconclusive whether..."
That's about it.

Paper 1:

This seems like some kind of letter between the boss and a higher-up.
It's mostly blacked out with ink.
"...We're running out of ways to get it out of there. We have to think of a more efficient method."

Paper 2:

This is a small note on an index card.
"We've seen the reports. It doesn't matter. Do it anyway."
